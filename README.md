# replicates_protocol

You should place the input files in the 01 folder and correctly check if the steps in the `lanza_prep.sh` file are suitable for your case, as well as change the number of replicates to the required amount!

Example of input files: `topology.parm7`, `coordinates.crd`

You must modify the input files in the `arq_entrada` folder for your system, keeping in mind that each system is unique.

Also, modify the `lanza_rep.sh` file in the 01 folder to match the steps that will be performed.
